Thank you for considering this request! By replying #YesWalmart in response to a request from or on behalf of Walmart Inc., You assent to the terms and conditions of use set forth below (“Terms”).  “You” or “Your” refers to the individual rights holder of the Content that is the subject matter of these Terms.\n\nWalmart Inc., on behalf of the company and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively “Walmart”), is interested in the Content recently published by You through one or more third-party sites or platforms including but not limited to Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter (the “Third Party Platforms”), and would like to request Your permission to share Your Content in its original form or as edited by the Walmart marketing team.  Please review these Terms to determine whether You wish to grant Walmart the rights and permissions set forth herein.\n\nAs used herein, the term “Content” shall refer to any picture, graphic, drawing, image, illustrations, text, video recordings, sound recordings, or other material You have posted online or through Third Party Platforms, together with your name, likeness and other identifying information provided, including without limitation any social media identifier, handle or profile picture.\n\nWalmart does not claim ownership rights in Your Content.  However, by agreeing to these Terms, You hereby grant to Walmart as licensee, and its parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, successors and assigns, an irrevocable, fully paid up, non-exclusive, world-wide, sub-licensable, transferable and royalty-free license to use the Content for the purpose of marketing, distributing and selling products or services, or for other promotional or informational purposes in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, including but not limited to use in social media, website, mobile application, email, retail and in-store for a perpetual term (the “License”).  You understand that Walmart may edit the Content for marketing purposes without Your written approval.\n\nBy agreeing to these Terms, You hereby warrant and represent that: (a) You are the sole owner of the Content, including but not limited to, all copyright rights therein; (b) You have the authority to agree to these Terms and provide the rights granted hereby; (c) You and any persons appearing in the Content are U.S. residents; (d) You and any persons appearing in the content are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority and you have obtained any necessary releases from any person(s) appearing in the Content or, if such persons are minors, You have obtained the authorization and release from a parent or legal guardian of any such person(s) under the age of 18 who appear in the Content; (e) the License does not infringe any third party’s rights; (f) there are no pending or threatened lawsuits concerning any aspect of the Content; (g) You have obtained any necessary releases from the owner of any property appearing in the Content, and (h) any statements made in the Content regarding Walmart and its products reflect Your honest opinions and beliefs, and are based on Your actual experiences regarding the Walmart and/or its products.\n\nYou further irrevocably waive any “moral rights” or other rights with respect to attribution of authorship or integrity of materials regarding the Content that You may have under any applicable law under any legal theory.  You hereby waive, discharge, and agree to hold Walmart, and any person acting on Walmart’s behalf, harmless for any and all claims against Walmart for payment, or claims relating to defamation, copyright infringement and/or any invasion or misappropriation of the right of privacy or publicity, or any other claim arising out of the use of the Content pursuant to these Terms.\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that we may choose not to use Your Content or to remove Your Content from any Walmart-controlled media or materials at any time.

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to these to these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that You may assert claims in small claims court if Your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that You or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.\n\nBy replying #YesWalmart, You unconditionally accept these Terms and these Terms shall constitute the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter therein.  This License may not be amended or rescinded except by a writing signed by You and Walmart, and removing Your consent from the platform on which it was originally provided shall not serve to void, terminate, or alter these Terms or the enforcement thereof.  This License shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and heirs.

This includes the right to edit your content without your approval.\n   \n2. **Waiver of Rights**: You waive any moral rights regarding your content, meaning you cannot claim authorship or object to how your content is used or modified.\n\n3. **Liability Waiver**: You agree to hold Walmart harmless from any claims related to your content, including defamation or copyright infringement, which could expose you to legal risks.\n\n4. **Arbitration Clause**: Any disputes must be resolved through binding arbitration, limiting your ability to take legal action in court.

By agreeing to these terms, you give Walmart extensive rights to use your content for marketing without paying you or needing your approval for edits.

Your Privacy. Your privacy is important to us. Please read the Microsoft Privacy Statement (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) (the \""Privacy Statement\"") as it describes the types of data we collect from you and your devices (\""Data\""), how we use your Data, and the legal bases we have to process your Data. The Privacy Statement also describes how Microsoft uses your content, which is your communications with others; postings submitted by you to Microsoft via the Services; and the files, photos, documents, audio, digital works, livestreams and videos that you upload, store, broadcast, create, generate, or share through the Services or inputs that you submit in order to generate content (\""Your Content\""). Where processing is based on consent and to the extent permitted by law, by agreeing to these Terms, you consent to Microsoft’s collection, use and disclosure of Your Content and Data as described in the Privacy Statement. In some cases, we will provide separate notice and request your consent as referenced in the Privacy Statement.\n\nYour Content\n2. Your Content. Many of our Services allow you to create, store or share Your Content or receive material from others. We don’t claim ownership of Your Content. Your Content remains yours and you are responsible for it.\n\na. When you share Your Content with other people, you understand that they may be able to, on a worldwide basis, use, save, record, reproduce, broadcast, transmit, share and display Your Content for the purpose that you made Your Content available on the Services without compensating you. If you do not want others to have that ability, do not use the Services to share Your Content. You represent and warrant that for the duration of these Terms, you have (and will have) all the rights necessary for Your Content that is uploaded, stored, or shared on or through the Services and that the collection, use, and retention of Your Content will not violate any law or rights of others. Microsoft cannot be held responsible for Your Content or the material others upload, store or share using the Services.\nb. To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others, to protect you and the Services, and to improve Microsoft products and services, you grant to Microsoft a worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property license to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, display, and distribute via communication tools Your Content on the Services. If you publish Your Content in areas of the Service where it is available broadly online without restrictions, Your Content may appear in demonstrations or materials that promote the Service. Some of the Services are supported by advertising. Controls for how Microsoft personalizes advertising are available at https://choice.live.com (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=286759). We do not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or other personal files, to target advertising to you. Our advertising policies are covered in detail in the Privacy Statement.\nCode of Conduct\n3. Code of Conduct. You are accountable for your conduct and content when using the Services.\n\na. By agreeing to these Terms, you’re agreeing that, when using the Services, you will follow these rules:\ni. Don’t do anything illegal, or try to generate or share content that is illegal.\nii. Don’t engage in any activity that exploits, harms, or threatens to harm children.\niii. Don’t send spam or engage in phishing, or try to generate or distribute malware. Spam is unwanted or unsolicited bulk email, postings, contact requests, SMS (text messages), instant messages, or similar electronic communications. Phishing is sending emails or other electronic communications to fraudulently or unlawfully induce recipients to reveal personal or sensitive information, such as passwords, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, credit card information, financial information, or other sensitive information, or to gain access to accounts or records, exfiltration of documents or other sensitive information, payment and/or financial benefit. Malware includes any activity designed to cause technical harm, such as delivering malicious executables, organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers.\niv. Don’t publicly display or use the Services to generate or share inappropriate content or material (involving, for example, nudity, bestiality, pornography, offensive language, graphic violence, self-harm, or criminal activity).\nv. Don’t engage in activity that is fraudulent, false or misleading (e.g., asking for money under false pretenses, impersonating someone else, creating fake accounts, automating inauthentic activity, generating or sharing content that is intentionally deceptive, manipulating the Services to increase play count, or affect rankings, ratings, or comments).\nvi. Don’t circumvent any restrictions on access to, usage, or availability of the Services (e.g., attempting to “jailbreak” an AI system or impermissible scraping).\nvii. Don’t engage in activity that is harmful to you, the Services, or others (e.g., transmitting viruses, stalking, trying to generate or sharing content that harasses, bullies or threatens others, posting terrorist or violent extremist content, communicating hate speech, or advocating violence against others).\nviii. Don’t violate or infringe upon the rights of others (e.g., unauthorized sharing of copyrighted music or other copyrighted material, resale or other distribution of Bing maps, or taking photographs or video/audio recordings of others without their consent for processing of an individual’s biometric identifiers/information or any other purpose using any of the Services).\nix. Don’t engage in activity that violates the privacy of others.\nx. Don’t help others break these rules.\nMore information about our policies, moderation and enforcement processes and service specific terms is available at aka.ms/trustandsafety.\nUsing the Services & Support\n4. Using the Services & Support.\n\na. Microsoft account. You’ll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services. Your Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners.\ni. Creating an Account. You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account. In some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you. If you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account. Please review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms. If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity. To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.\nii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you. If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership. Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content. If you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656.\niii. Kids and Accounts. By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and represent that you have either reached the age of \""majority\"" where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.\niv. Closing Your Account.\n1. You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason. To close your Microsoft account, please visit https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx. When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, you can choose to put it in a suspended state for either 30 or 60 days just in case you change your mind. After that 30- or 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed. Logging back in during the suspension period will reactivate your Microsoft account.\n2. If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). You should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won’t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired.\nb. Moderation and Enforcement. Many of our Services that allow you to interact, create, generate, and share content with others leverage safety systems to protect our Services and other users.\ni. Policies. Our Code of Conduct identifies what’s prohibited when using our Services. Specific Services have additional policies and community standards applicable to their users, which are available here (https://aka.ms/trustandsafety).\nii. Reporting a Concern. You can report concerning content or conduct that may violate our Code of Conduct here (https://aka.ms/reportconcerns).\niii. Review. Where applicable, we may use automated systems and humans to review content to identify suspected spam, viruses, fraud, phishing, malware, jailbreaking, or other illegal or harmful content or conduct.\niv. Enforcement. We reserve the right to deny content if it exceeds limits on storage or file size allowed by the Service. We may block, remove or decline to display content if it appears to violate our Code of Conduct or another Service policy or where required by law. If you violate these terms or Service-Specific Terms, we may take action against your account. This could include limiting access to certain features or Services, stopping providing Services, closing your Microsoft account immediately or blocking delivery of a communication (like email, file sharing or instant message) to or from the Services. Closure of your access to a Service or your account may result in forfeiture of content licenses, associated content, memberships, and Microsoft account balances associated with the account. When reviewing alleged violations of these Terms, Microsoft reserves the right to review content to resolve the issue. However, we cannot monitor the entire Services and make no attempt to do so. For more information about the moderation and enforcement processes, Service specific terms and appeals, see https://aka.ms/trustandsafety. Information about our policy relating to claims of intellectual property infringement may be found at NOTICES.\nc. Work or School Accounts. You can sign into certain Microsoft services with a work or school email address. If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised. You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization and these Terms may not apply. If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.\nd. Additional Equipment/Data Plans. To use many of the Services, you’ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan. You might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you.\ne. Service Notifications. When there’s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we’ll send you Service notifications. If you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases. We may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages). Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.\nf. Support. Customer support for some Services is available at https://support.microsoft.com. Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at https://microsoft.com/support-service-agreement, unless otherwise specified. Support may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or Services.\ng. Ending your Services. If your Services are canceled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your license to the software related to the Services ends. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). As a result you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you’ve stored on those Services). You should have a regular backup plan. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired. If you have canceled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be canceled immediately.\nUsing Third-Party Apps and Services\n5. Using Third-Party Apps and Services. The Services may allow you to access or acquire products, services, websites, links, content, material, games, skills, integrations, bots or applications from independent third parties (companies or people who aren’t Microsoft) (\""Third-Party Apps and Services\""). Many of our Services also help you find, make requests to, or interact with Third-Party Apps and Services or allow you to share Your Content or Data, and you understand that by using our Services you are directing them to make Third-Party Apps and Services available to you. The Third-Party Apps and Services may allow you to store Your Content or Data with the publisher, provider or operator of the Third-Party Apps and Services. The Third-Party Apps and Services may present you with a privacy policy or require you to accept their terms before you can install or use the Third-Party App or Service. See section 14.b for additional terms for applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Office Store, the Microsoft Store on Xbox and the Microsoft Store on Windows). You should review the third-party terms and privacy policies before acquiring, using, requesting, or linking your Microsoft Account to any Third-Party Apps and Services. Any third-party terms do not modify any of these Terms. You are responsible for your dealings with third parties. Microsoft does not license any intellectual property to you as part of any Third-Party Apps and Services and is not responsible or liable to you or others for information or services provided by any Third-Party Apps and Services.\n\nService Availability\n6. Service Availability.\n\na. The Services, Third-Party Apps and Services, or material or products offered through the Services may be unavailable from time to time, may be offered for a limited time, or may vary depending on your region or device. If you change the location associated with your Microsoft account, you may need to re-acquire the material or applications that were available to you and paid for in your previous region.\nb. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and Microsoft is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result. In the event of an outage, you may not be able to retrieve Your Content or Data that you’ve stored. We recommend that you regularly backup Your Content and Data that you store on the Services or store using Third-Party Apps and Services.\nUpdates to the Services or Software, and Changes to These Terms\n7. Updates to the Services or Software, and Changes to These Terms.\n\na. We may change these Terms at any time, and we’ll tell you when we do. Using the Services after the changes become effective means you agree to the new terms. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you must stop using the Services, close your Microsoft account and, if you are a parent or guardian, help your minor child close his or her Microsoft account.\nb. Sometimes you’ll need software updates to keep using the Services. We may automatically check your version of the software and download software updates or configuration changes. You may also be required to update the software to continue using the Services. Such updates are subject to these Terms unless other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other terms apply. Microsoft isn’t obligated to make any updates available and we don’t guarantee that we will support the version of the system or device for which you purchased or licensed the software, apps, content or other products.\nc. Additionally, there may be times when we need to remove or change features or functionality of the Service or stop providing a Service or access to Third-Party Apps and Services altogether. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we have no obligation to provide a re-download or replacement of any material, Digital Goods (defined in section 14.j), or applications previously purchased. We may release the Services or their features in a preview or beta version, which may not work correctly or in the same way the final version may work.\nd. So that you can use material protected with digital rights management (DRM), like some music, games, movies, books and more, DRM software may automatically contact an online rights server and download and install DRM updates.\nSoftware License\n8. Software License. Unless accompanied by a separate Microsoft license agreement (for example, if you are using a Microsoft application that is included with and a part of Windows, then the Microsoft Software License Terms for the Windows Operating System govern such software), any software provided by us to you as part of the Services is subject to these Terms. Applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Windows and Microsoft Store on Xbox) are subject to section 14.b.i below.\n\na. If you comply with these Terms, we grant you the right to install and use one copy of the software per device on a worldwide basis for use by only one person at a time as part of your use of the Services. For certain devices, such software may be pre-installed for your personal, non-commercial use of the Services. The software or website that is part of the Services may include third-party code. Any third-party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from the software or website, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Microsoft. Notices, if any, for the third-party code are included for your information only.\nb. The software is licensed, not sold, and Microsoft reserves all rights to the software not expressly granted by Microsoft, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. This license does not give you any right to, and you may not:\ni. circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or relating to the software or Services;\nii. disassemble, decompile, decrypt, hack, emulate, exploit, or reverse engineer any software or other aspect of the Services that is included in or accessible through the Services, except and only to the extent that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so;\niii. separate components of the software or Services for use on different devices;\niv. publish, copy, rent, lease, sell, export, import, distribute, or lend the software or the Services, unless Microsoft expressly authorizes you to do so;\nv. transfer the software, any software licenses, or any rights to access or use the Services;\nvi. use the Services in any unauthorized way that could interfere with anyone else’s use of them or gain access to any service, data, account, or network;\nvii. enable access to the Services or modify any Microsoft-authorized device (e.g., Xbox consoles, Microsoft Surface, etc.) by unauthorized third-party applications.\nPayment Terms\n9. Payment Terms. If you purchase a Service, then these payment terms apply to your purchase and you agree to them.\n\na. Charges. If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge. The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. The price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.\nb. Your Billing Account. To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service. You can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing into your account portal at https://skype.com/go/myaccount. Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions. Changes made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.\nc. Billing. By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.\nd. Recurring Payments. When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft. You must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services. We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, \""Electronic Payments\""). Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.\ne. Online Statement and Errors. Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282), where you can view and print your statement. For Skype, you can access your online statement by signing into your account at www.skype.com (https://www.skype.com). This is the only billing statement that we provide. If we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill. We will then promptly investigate the charge. If you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund. If Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days.\nf. Refund Policy. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply. For more refund information, please visit our help topic (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283).\ng. Canceling the Services. You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause. Cancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service. To cancel a Service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website. You can request a refund from Skype using the Cancellation and Refund form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286). You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; and (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services. We will process your Data as described above in section 4. If you cancel, your access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled. If you initiate a chargeback or reversal with your bank for your payment of Services, we will deem you to have canceled as of the date that the original payment was made, and you authorize us to immediately cancel your service and/or revoke any content that was provided to you in exchange for such payment.\nh. Trial-Period Offers. If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period.\ni. Promotional Offers. From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services. Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.\nj. Price Changes. We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.\nk. Payments to You. If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.\nl. Gift Cards. Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions). Information on Skype gift cards is available on Skype’s Help page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383).\nm. Bank Account Payment Method. You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method. Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house (\""ACH\"") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area (\""SEPA\"") or \""iDEAL\"" in the Netherlands). Terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the “mandate” in the case of SEPA) also apply. You represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a payment method. By registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits. You understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account. Contact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error. Laws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions from your bank account. By registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms.\nContracting Entity, Choice of Law, Jurisdiction\n10.

Microsoft Rewards (the \""Rewards Program\"") is free to join, and it enables you to earn points (\""Points\"") for certain activities and for personal use of certain Microsoft products and services. If you have a Microsoft account and are located in a participating Region (defined below), you have been automatically enrolled in the Rewards Program and can begin earning Points immediately. You can cancel your participation in the Rewards Program at any time by following the instructions below.\nii. You can redeem your Points in a variety of ways (\""Redemption Options\""), including for certain products and services listed on the Redemption Page at https://aka.ms/redeemrewards (\""Rewards\""). To be eligible to redeem your Points for any Redemption Option, you must first activate your Rewards Program account (\""Rewards Account\"") on the Rewards Dashboard at https://rewards.microsoft.com/ or on certain other Microsoft sites and pages. There is no cost to activate your Rewards Account.\niii. Certain restrictions and limitations apply to earning, redeeming, and other uses of Points in the Rewards Program. For more information see the Rewards section at https://support.microsoft.com (\""FAQ\"").\niv. Requirements. You need a valid Microsoft account and you must reside in one of the geographic areas listed in the FAQ (\""Regions\"") to activate your Rewards Account and to earn, redeem, or otherwise use Points. You may open and use only one Rewards Account, even if you have multiple email addresses. Each household is limited to six Rewards Accounts. The Rewards Program is solely for your personal and noncommercial use. Use of a virtual private network (VPN) or other technology or service that can be used to mask or obfuscate your geographic location may result in cancellation of your Rewards Account and forfeiture of your accrued Points.\nv. Earning Points. You may be presented with opportunities to earn Points for certain qualifying activities (\""Offers\""), such as Searches, Acquisitions, use of certain Microsoft products and services, and other opportunities from Microsoft. You must have an active Rewards Account to take advantage of such Offers. Eligible Offers may vary by Region and may only be available for a certain time or subject to other limitations. You must comply with all terms and conditions of a particular Offer to earn Points awarded with that Offer. You may be presented with Offers directly on the Rewards Dashboard or when you use certain Microsoft products and services.\nvi. For purposes of the Rewards Program, a \""Search\"" is the act of an individual user manually entering text for the good faith purpose of obtaining Bing search results for such user’s own research purposes and does not include any query entered by a bot, macro, or other automated or fraudulent means of any kind; and an \""Acquisition\"" is the process of purchasing goods or downloading and acquiring a license for digital content directly from Microsoft, whether free or paid. Points are not offered for every Acquisition from Microsoft, and certain restrictions may apply.\nvii. Restrictions & Limitations on Points. Points are awarded by Microsoft to individual Rewards Accounts and cannot be transferred to any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Microsoft may from time to time in its sole discretion permit you (i) to share your Points within your household (limits may apply), (ii) to contribute your Points to support a nonprofit organization listed on the Redemption Page, or (iii) depending on your Region and subject to other terms and conditions, to redeem all or some of your Points for points in certain other rewards or loyalty programs, including programs operated by Microsoft or authorized third parties. Points are and remain at all times the property of Microsoft, and do not constitute your personal property; they have no cash value, and you may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for them. Points are awarded to you on a promotional basis only. You cannot purchase Points. Microsoft may limit the quantity of Points or Rewards that can be earned or redeemed per person, per household, or over a set period (e.g., a day) provided that you are not disadvantaged in breach of good faith; please refer to the FAQ for currently applicable limitations. Unless an Offer or Redemption Option explicitly states otherwise, Points earned in the Program are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any other program offered by Microsoft or third parties. Unredeemed Points associated with your Rewards Account expire if you do not earn or redeem any Points in your Rewards Account for 18 consecutive months.\nviii. Redemptions Redemption Options will be made available to you on the Redemption Page and on certain other Microsoft sites and pages. You must earn and have available in your Rewards Account all of the Points required for a Redemption Option before you can redeem your Points for that Redemption Option. There may be a limited number of a particular Reward available, and those Rewards will be delivered on a first-come, first-served basis. You may be required to provide additional information, like your mailing address and a telephone number (other than a VOIP or toll-free number), and you may also be asked to enter a fraud-prevention code or sign additional legal documents to redeem Points for certain Redemption Options. Once you redeem your Points, you cannot cancel or return the Redemption Option for a refund of Points except in the case of defective products or as required by applicable law. If you select a Redemption Option that is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons, we may substitute a Redemption Option of comparable value or refund your points at our sole discretion.\nix. Microsoft may update or discontinue offering specific Redemption Options at any time for any reason. Some Redemption Options may have age or Region eligibility requirements, or other terms or conditions on their redemption or use. Any such requirements or conditions will be included in the relevant redemption offer. You are responsible for all federal, state, and local taxes and any other costs of accepting and using the Redemption Option. Rewards will be emailed to the email address associated with your Microsoft account, so keep your email address up to date. Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued and are therefore forfeited. Rewards may not be resold. You may redeem no more than 550,000 Points per calendar year in the Rewards Program.\nx. Cancelling Your Rewards Account. If you no longer wish to participate in the Rewards Program, follow the instructions on the opt out page (https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/optout?confirm=false) to cancel your Rewards Account. If you cancel your Rewards Account, you will immediately forfeit all of your earned Points and will lose your ability to earn new Points in the future. To begin earning Points again, you must open a new Rewards Account (but Microsoft will not reinstate any previously forfeited Points). Your Rewards Account may be cancelled (and your Points forfeited) if you do not log in to your Microsoft account for 18 consecutive months.\nxi. Program Changes or Discontinuation. Microsoft reserves the right to change, modify, discontinue, or cancel the Rewards Program or any part thereof at any time, in its sole discretion, and without prior notice. However, if the Rewards Program is cancelled or discontinued, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you by email and on the Rewards Dashboard and to provide you with at least 90 days to redeem your accrued Points, unless we determine that such cancellation must take effect immediately for legal or security reasons.\nxii. Other Terms. Microsoft reserves the right to immediately cancel your Rewards Account, disqualify you from future participation in the Rewards Program, forfeit all of your earned Points, and cancel or suspend any Redemption Option you have obtained through the Rewards Program if Microsoft believes you have tampered with, abused, or defrauded any aspect of the Rewards Program or breached these terms. Microsoft further reserves the right to cancel or suspend any Redemption Option you have obtained or attempted to obtain through the Rewards Program if Microsoft determines you are ineligible to receive that Redemption Option for legal reasons (such as export laws). While Microsoft makes every effort to ensure accuracy, errors occasionally occur. Microsoft therefore reserves the right to correct such errors at any time, even if it affects current Offers or your pending, earned, or redeemed Points or Rewards. In the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between these Rewards Program terms or other statements contained in any related materials or advertising, these terms prevail, govern, and control.\nAzure\nm.

Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In (or, If a Business, Your Principal Place of Business Is In) the United States. We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days, upon receipt of a Notice of Dispute, to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (\""AAA\"") under the Federal Arbitration Act (\""FAA\""), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, requests for public injunctions, and any other proceeding or request for relief where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. \""We,\"" \""our,\"" and \""us\"" includes Microsoft and Microsoft’s affiliates.\n\na. Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP. The term \""dispute\"" is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, the Services’ or software’s price, your Microsoft account, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.\nb. Send a Notice of Dispute Before Arbitration. If you have a dispute that our customer service representatives can’t resolve and you wish to pursue arbitration, you must first send an individualized Notice of Dispute to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A., or submit the form electronically. The Notice of Dispute form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499. Complete that form in full, with all the information it requires. We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. This Notice of Dispute is a prerequisite to initiating any arbitration. Any applicable statute of limitations will be tolled from the date of a properly submitted individualized Notice of Dispute through the first date on which an arbitration may properly be filed under this section 15.\nc. Small Claims Court Option. Instead of sending a Notice of Dispute, either you or we may sue the other party in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action meets the small claims court’s requirements and remains an individual action seeking individualized relief. The small claims court must be in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business).\nd. Arbitration Procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is less than $75,000 whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. Section 15 and these Terms govern to the extent they conflict with any applicable AAA rules. To initiate an arbitration, submit the Demand for Arbitration form available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497 to the AAA and mail a copy to us. The form must contain information that is specific to you and your claim. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic or by videoconference unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business). The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim, but not relief that would affect non-parties.\nThe arbitrator rules on all issues except that a court has exclusive authority: (i) to decide arbitrability, as well as formation, existence, scope, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement; (ii) to decide whether the parties have complied with the pre-arbitration requirements (including the individualized Notice of Dispute and Demand for Arbitration forms); (iii) to enforce the prohibition on class, representative, private attorney-general, or combined actions or proceedings, or public injunctive relief; and (iv) to enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this section 15.\n\nIf your Notice of Dispute involves claims similar to those of at least 24 other customers, and if you and those other customers are represented by the same lawyers, or by lawyers who are coordinating with each other, you and we agree that these claims will be “Related Cases.” Related Cases may only be filed in batches of up to 50 individual arbitrations at a time, and those individual arbitrations will be resolved in the following manner: (i) for the first batch, each side may select up to 25 of these Related Cases to be filed and resolved in individual arbitrations under this section 15; (ii) none of the other Related Cases may be filed or prosecuted in arbitration until the first batch of up to 50 individual arbitrations is resolved; and (iii) if, after that first batch, the parties are unable to informally resolve the remaining Related Cases, a second batch of Related Cases may be filed, where each side may select up to 25 of the Related Cases to be resolved in individual arbitrations under this section 15. This process of batched individual arbitrations will continue until the parties resolve all Related Cases informally or through individual arbitrations. A court has exclusive authority to enforce this paragraph, including whether it applies to a given set of claims, and to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations that do not comply with this paragraph.\n\ne. Arbitration Fees and Payments.\ni. Disputes Involving Less Than $75,000. We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses if: (i) the dispute involves less than $75,000; and before initiating arbitration (ii) you complied with all pre-arbitration requirements in this section 15, including, if applicable, the Related Cases paragraph. Otherwise, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If, at the conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator awards you more than our last written offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, we will: pay you (i) the amount of the award or $1,000 (whichever is more); and; (ii) for any reasonable attorney’s fees you incurred; and any reasonable expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney accrued in connection with your individual arbitration.\nii. Disputes Involving $75,000 or More. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.\nf. Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by personally signing and sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in section 15.b. If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply.\ng. Severability. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court finds any part of this section 15 unenforceable as to any claim or request for a remedy, then the parties agree to arbitrate all claims and remedies subject to arbitration before litigating in court any remaining claims or remedies (such as a request for a public injunction remedy, in which case the arbitrator issues an award on liability and individual relief before a court considers that request). Otherwise, if any other part of section 15 is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins).\nMiscellaneous\n16. Miscellaneous. This section, and sections 1, 9 (for amounts incurred before the end of these Terms), 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18 and those that by their terms apply after the Terms end will survive any termination or cancellation of these Terms. We may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms or transfer any rights to use the Services. This is the entire agreement between you and Microsoft for your use of the Services. It supersedes any prior agreements between you and Microsoft regarding your use of the Services. All parts of these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law. If a court or arbitrator holds that we can't enforce a part of these Terms as written, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms won't change. Section 15.g says what happens if parts of section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be unenforceable. Section 15.g prevails over this section if inconsistent with it. Except for section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) these Terms are solely for your and our benefit; they aren’t for the benefit of any other person, except for Microsoft’s successors and assigns.\n\n17. Export Laws. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software and/or Services, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use.

Users consent to this data processing by agreeing to the terms, which may raise concerns about how personal information is handled.\n\n2. **Your Content**: Users retain ownership of their content but must understand that sharing it may allow others to use it without compensation.

Violations can lead to account termination, which may be concerning for users who may inadvertently breach these rules.\n\n4. **Account Management**: Users must maintain an active Microsoft account by signing in at least once every two years. Failure to do so may result in account closure and loss of associated content. This could be a concern for users who may forget to log in.\n\n5. **Arbitration and Class Action Waiver**: Users agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration rather than in court, waiving their right to participate in class action lawsuits.

In the unlikely event that Fit3D has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after thirty (30) days, you and Fit3D agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Product (collectively, \""Disputes\"") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an \""IP Protection Action\""); and (iii) you retain the right to litigate any Dispute other than an IP Protection Action by providing Fit3D with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at our contact information at the bottom of these Terms within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms (such notice, an \""Arbitration Opt-out Notice\"").\n\nIf you do not provide Fit3D with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Fit3D with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Fit3D with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Fit3D are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Fit3D otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \""Dispute Resolution\"" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this \""Dispute Resolution\"" section will survive any termination of these Terms.\n\nArbitration Rules\nThe arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\""AAA\"") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \""AAA Rules\"") then in effect, except as modified by this \""Dispute Resolution\"" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\n\nArbitration Process\nA party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration athttp://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820 and a separate form for California residents athttp://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822). The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\n\nArbitration Location and Procedure\nUnless you and Fit3D otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where We reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Fit3D submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n\nArbitrator's Decision\nThe arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the \""Limitation of Liability\"" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Fit3D will seek to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.\n\nArbitration Fees\nYour responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Fit3D will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\n\nChanges to the Dispute Resolution Clause\nIf Fit3D changes this \""Dispute Resolution\"" section after the date on which you placed your order for a Product, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to legal@fit3d.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the \""Last Updated\"" date above or in the date of Fit3D's email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Fit3D in accordance with the provisions of this \""Dispute Resolution\"" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).\n"", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""human""}]","{""data"": {""name"": """", ""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""I am not a lawyer and my response is not intended as legal advice.

If not resolved within 30 days, disputes must be settled through binding arbitration, waiving the right to a jury trial or class action. Users have a limited window (30 days) to opt-out of arbitration, and failure to do so means they cannot litigate disputes in court.\n\n3. **Limitation on Legal Rights**: By agreeing to these terms, users waive their rights to participate in class action lawsuits and must resolve disputes individually through arbitration. This could limit users' ability to seek collective redress.\n\n4. **Arbitration Fees**: While Fit3D will cover arbitration fees for claims under $75,000, users may still be responsible for fees if the arbitrator finds the claim frivolous. This could deter users from pursuing legitimate claims.\n\n5. **Changes to the Dispute Resolution Clause**: Users can reject changes to the dispute resolution terms by notifying Fit3D within 30 days. However, this requires users to be vigilant about any changes made after their initial acceptance of the terms.\n\n### High-Level Summary of the Document:\nThe document outlines the dispute resolution process for users of the Fit3D Platform. It establishes that California law governs the terms and requires users to attempt informal resolution before arbitration. If disputes are not resolved within 30 days, they must be settled through binding arbitration, which limits users' rights to a jury trial and class actions. Users have a 30-day window to opt-out of arbitration, and there are specific rules regarding arbitration fees and the process itself. Additionally, users can reject changes to the dispute resolution terms but must act quickly to do so. Overall, this section emphasizes that users are giving up certain legal rights in favor of arbitration.\n\nIf you have more sections to analyze or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""ai""}"

This includes:\t\nAccount information\n\nYou don't need an account to use Reddit. If you create a Reddit account, your account will have a username, which you provide or which is automatically generated. Your username is public, and it doesn't have to be related to your real name. You may need to provide a password, depending on whether you register using an email address, Single Sign-On (SSO) feature (such as Apple or Google), or phone number. If your account does not have a password, we may send you a SMS message for verification purposes. We may also ask you to select interests during account creation (for example, history, nature, sports) to help generate a home feed for you, or to select communities (such as, r/technology) to join.\n\nWhen you use Reddit, you may also provide other information, such as a bio, gender, age, location, profile picture, or social link. This information is optional and may be removed at any time.\n\nWe also store your user account preferences and settings. We may ask for such information prior to you creating a username or account to help improve your experience exploring Reddit.\n\nNon-Public Content You Submit\n\nIn addition to the public content you submit to the Services, we also collect non-public content. This includes your saved drafts of posts or comments, your messages with other users (such as private messages, chats, and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, audio, videos, software, and tools.\n\nActions you take\n\nWe collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with the platform and content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, and blocking. We collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.\n\nTransactional information\n\nIf you purchase products or services from us or otherwise through the Services, you will have to provide payment information in order to complete your purchase. Reddit uses industry-standard payment processor services (such as Stripe) to handle payment information, and those services are subject to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies. We will collect information about the product or service you are purchasing (for example, purchase dates, amounts paid or received, and expiration and renewal dates).\n\nWe may also collect public blockchain data and addresses, such as when you purchase or create a Collectible Avatar, receive or mint an NFT, or create a Reddit Vault. However, we never store Reddit Vault private key information.\n\nOther information\n\nYou may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, survey, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities, promotions, or programs, apply for a job, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.\n\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically\nWhen you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:\t\nLog and usage data\n\nWe may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (such as device IDs), device settings, mobile carrier name, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.\n\nInformation collected from cookies and similar technologies\n\nWe may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to deliver and maintain our Services, improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, measure the effectiveness of advertising, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. See our Cookie Notice for more information about how Reddit uses cookies. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see “Your Choices” below.\n\nLocation information\n\nWe may receive and process information about your location. We may receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including via the Location Customization setting or by associating your content with a location, or we may derive an approximate location based on your IP address.\n\n\nInformation Collected from Other Sources\nWe may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers (such as the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and combine it with data you have provided to Reddit, using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to personalize advertisements for you by visiting the User Settings menu in your account, as described in the section titled “Your Rights and Choices” below.\nLinked services\n\nIf you authorize or link a third-party service, such as an unofficial mobile app client, to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service. For example, if you sign in to Reddit with a third-party identity provider, that provider may share an email address with us. To learn how information is shared with linked services, see “How Information About You Is Shared” below.\n\nInformation collected from integrations\n\nWe also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate our Services, including our embeds and advertising technology. For example, when you visit a site that uses Reddit embeds, we may receive information about the web page you visited. Similarly, if an advertiser incorporates Reddit’s ad technology, Reddit may receive limited information about your activity on the advertiser’s site or app, such as whether you bought something from the advertiser. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you as described in “Your Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics” below.\n\n\nInformation Collected by Third Parties\t\nEmbedded content\n\nReddit displays some linked content in-line on the Services via embeds. For example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or X may load the linked video or tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don't have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is embedded.\n\nAudience measurement\n\nWe partner with service providers that perform audience measurement to learn demographic information about the population that uses Reddit.

Users may not be fully aware of the extent of data collection.\n\n2. **Public vs. Non-Public Content**: While users can choose to share certain information publicly, non-public content (like private messages and saved drafts) is also collected, which may raise privacy concerns.\n\n3. **Third-Party Data Sharing**: Reddit may receive information from third parties, including advertisers and linked services, which can complicate user privacy and control over personal data.\n\n4. **Cookies and Tracking**: The use of cookies and similar technologies for tracking user behavior and personalizing ads may be concerning for users who prefer not to be tracked.\n\n5. **Embedded Content**: Data collection by third-party services through embedded content is not governed by Reddit's privacy policy, which could lead to users being unaware of how their data is being used elsewhere.\n\n### High-Level Summary of the Document:\nThis section outlines the types of information Reddit collects from users, including both information users provide directly (like account details and messages) and information collected automatically (like IP addresses and device data). It also explains how Reddit may gather information from third parties and how embedded content from other services can lead to additional data collection. Users are informed about their choices regarding data sharing and privacy settings.\n\n### Key Points for Users:\n- **Extensive Data Collection**: Users should be aware that Reddit collects a significant amount of personal information, which may include sensitive data.\n- **Public and Private Data**: While users can control some of the information they share, non-public interactions are also recorded, which may not be as easily managed.\n- **Third-Party Involvement**: Users may have limited control over how their data is shared with third parties, especially when using linked services or interacting with embedded content.\n- **Cookies and Tracking**: Users should consider their preferences regarding cookies and tracking, as these are used to enhance user experience but may compromise privacy.\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of Reddit's data collection practices, highlighting the importance for users to understand what information is collected and how it is used.
