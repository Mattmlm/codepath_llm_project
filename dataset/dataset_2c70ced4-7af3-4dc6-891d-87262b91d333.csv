Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.\nHowever, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a \""license\"") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.\nSpecifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services. This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems.\nYou can delete individual content you share, post, and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. Learn more about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in Shared Albums which may continue to be visible to other album members.\nIt may take up to 90 days to delete content after we begin the account deletion process or receive a content deletion request. If you send content to trash, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you chose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems."", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""human""}]","{""data"": {""name"": """", ""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""I am not a lawyer and my response is not intended as legal advice. I am simply an AI trained to analyze legal documents.\n\n### Concerning Clause Summary:\n1. **License Grant**: By sharing content, you grant Meta a broad license to use your content in various ways (e.g., hosting, modifying, distributing) without paying you. This license is non-exclusive, meaning they can allow others to use it too, and it lasts until you delete the content.\n2. **Content Deletion Process**: While you can delete your content, it may take up to 90 days for the deletion to be fully processed, and even longer for it to be removed from backups. This means your content may still exist in some form even after you think itâ€™s deleted.\n3. **Shared Content**: If you post content as an admin or in shared albums, it may remain visible to others even if you delete your account, which could lead to unintended sharing of your content.\n\n### High-Level Summary:\nThis section explains that when you share content on Meta platforms (like Facebook), you still own your content, but you give Meta permission to use it in various ways. You can delete your content at any time, but the deletion process can take a while, and some content may still be visible to others after you delete your account. \n\n### Key Points for Users:\n- **Ownership**: You retain ownership of your content.\n- **Permission**: You are granting Meta a wide-ranging license to use your content.\n- **Deletion**: Deleting content is not immediate; it can take time, and some content may remain visible to others.\n- **Shared Content**: Be cautious about what you share in group settings, as it may not be fully deleted when you leave.\n\n### Fairness & Transparency:\nThe terms are somewhat standard for social media platforms, but the broad license granted to Meta may be concerning for users who want more control over their shared content. The lengthy deletion process could also be seen as a lack of transparency regarding user data management."", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""ai""}"
