ORDERS 

Ordering Products
If you want to purchase Products from us, you may order using the then available order methods provided by Fit3D. Once you place your order, we will email you with an order confirmation ("Order Confirmation") that indicates that we have accepted your order. We are not bound to sell you any Product until we have accepted and processed your payment. With your Order Confirmation, we will confirm the quantity of Products you purchased, their price, and an estimated shipment date ("Estimated Shipment Date"). Our acceptance of your order is expressly conditioned on your unconditional acceptance of these Terms, even if you communicate with us otherwise. The terms of our Limited Warranty apply to any purchase and are incorporated herein by reference.

Pre-Orders
Fit3D commonly is back ordered, and therefore conducts pre-order sales for our Products whereby Fit3D takes orders and payment for our Products to be shipped at a future date ("Pre-Orders"). To secure a Pre-Order you will be required to pay a deposit to reserve your Product. At the time you place a Pre-Order, Fit3D will be able to provide an estimated timeframe for the shipment of the Product or service, but such estimates are not guaranteed and may be revised, extended, or modified by Fit3D. You will be contacted prior to shipment to supply a correct shipping address for Pre-Order Products and complete your payment in full. As a general policy, we do not allow Pre-Orders to be canceled and we do not provide refunds.  If we do make an exception, Fit3D will determine whether or not we will provide you any portion of your payment as a refund.    

Order Cancellation
As a general policy, we do not allow Orders to be canceled and we do not provide refunds.  If we do make an exception, Fit3D will determine whether or not we will provide you any refund.  You agree to not issue a chargeback or dispute the payments already made to Fit3D.  If We do make an exception to our Order Cancelation policy, Fit3D will determine whether or not We will provide You any portion of Your payment as a refund.  

Shipment and Delivery
We may provide a single shipping method and carrier, or multiple methods and carriers, for Product delivery, at our sole discretion. You will be responsible for all freight, packing, insurance and other shipping-related costs and expenses. Once the Product is sent to the carrier, ownership of the Product and the risk of that Product's loss passes to you.  If Fit3D incurs any additional costs to deliver the product to You, You will be responsible for those additional costs.

You understand that all scheduled shipment dates and Estimated Shipment Dates are estimates only. We will make reasonable efforts to meet the scheduled shipment dates, but in no event will we be liable for any loss, damage, or penalty resulting from any delay in shipment or delivery, nor will the carrier be deemed our agent. If you purchase multiple Products, we may send you your Products in installments and charge you separately for each installment. We have the right to allocate our available inventory of the Products among other purchasers in such manner as We see fit. If We are not able to charge your payment method or You fail to pay for Your purchase, We have the right to delay or suspend shipment of the Products.

Prices and Taxes
The prices for the Products will be as specified when we finalize your Order. Prices are stated in U.S. dollars.

You agree to pay all fees incurred by Your Account, including applicable taxes, in accordance with these Terms and other billing terms that may be in effect at the time that the fee becomes payable. Fit3D may add new Products and Services for additional fees, or proactively amend fees for existing Services, at any time in its sole discretion. You represent to Fit3D that You are an authorized user of the chosen method of payment used to pay all fees You incur.

Our fees only include California Sales Tax where such California Sales Tax is applicable. If the Products are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction other than California and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to us, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority. You agree to indemnify us for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Tax. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, "Sales Tax" shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that we are permitted to pass to customers that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

If we do make an exception, Fit3D will determine whether or not we will provide you any refund after we receive your Product in good working order with no cosmetic blemishes.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION 

Choice of Law
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

Agreement to Arbitrate
For any dispute with Fit3D, you agree to first contact us at legal@fit3d.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Fit3D has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after thirty (30) days, you and Fit3D agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Product (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an "IP Protection Action"); and (iii) you retain the right to litigate any Dispute other than an IP Protection Action by providing Fit3D with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at our contact information at the bottom of these Terms within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms (such notice, an "Arbitration Opt-out Notice").

If you do not provide Fit3D with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Fit3D with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Fit3D with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Fit3D are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Fit3D otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.

Arbitration Rules
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

Arbitration Process
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration athttp://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820 and a separate form for California residents athttp://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822). The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

Arbitration Location and Procedure
Unless you and Fit3D otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where We reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Fit3D submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

Arbitrator's Decision
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Fit3D will seek to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.

Arbitration Fees
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Fit3D will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
